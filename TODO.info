- GPUPipeline, Program validation: Find error cases before program compiles, because OpenGL logger doesn't precise error:
	- Failed to link program: Varying is not declared in one of shaders
	- Can't fin uniform location: Varying or uniform is never assigned
- OpenGL ES3: Vertices are drawn in wrong order
- Attributes, VAO: Both Normal and TBN VBOs are generated (Potential fix of problem above)
- Program, PipelineProgram: Pipeline and GPUProgram should have same base (glName, compile())
- ReflectionPlane, Camera: Camera orientation is mirrored only by (0 0 1 z) plane
- Get rid of old GPU* classes (ie Uniform, Attribute enums)
	- Create PipelinePrograms equivalents of all GPUPrograms
	- Remove all GPUPrograms
	- Remove old models (most are in GPUDomainModels.swift)
	- Cleanup

- Move all calculations to GameViewController.update method
- Write new indexification algorithm
- GPUPipeline, Program validation: Find error cases before program compiles, because OpenGL logger doesn't precise error:
	- Failed to link program: Varying is not declared in one of shaders
	- Can't fin uniform location: Varying or uniform is never assigned
- OpenGL ES3: Vertices are drawn in wrong order
- Get rid of old GPU* classes (ie Uniform, Attribute enums)
	- Cleanup
- Change DirectionalLight to Weather model, which includes: light direction, ambient light, specular function with scaling component (related or not to shininess), light color
- Wall material is horrible!!!
